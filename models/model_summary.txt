Layer	Output Shape	Parameters	Description
EfficientNetB0 (pretrained)	(None, 7, 7, 1280)	4,049,571	Acts as the feature extractor; pretrained on ImageNet. Only upper layers are fine-tuned to retain general visual features while adapting to acne-specific cues.
GlobalAveragePooling2D	(None, 1280)	0	Reduces spatial dimensions by averaging feature maps, maintaining the most relevant channel information.
Dropout (rate=0.3)	(None, 1280)	0	Helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
Dense (128 units, ReLU)	(None, 128)	163,968	Fully connected layer for learning non-linear combinations of features.
Dropout (rate=0.3)	(None, 128)	0	Additional regularization to improve generalization.
Dense (3 units, Softmax)	(None, 3)	387	Final output layer for 3-class acne grading (e.g., Mild, Moderate, Severe).
